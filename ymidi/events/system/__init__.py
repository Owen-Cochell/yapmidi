"""
THis sub-module contains MIDI system events.
System events are not within the musical context of MIDI,
and instead act as ways to alter meta aspects of the MIDI instance.
For example, the System Exclusive message allows for the transmitting device
to send unique info that allows it to be identified/interpreted in a special way.
