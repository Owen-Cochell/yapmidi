# yapmidi
Yet Another Python MIDI library

# Disclaimer

yapmidi is a huge work in progress!
Using this library as of now is not recommended.

# Soon to be...

yapmidi will eventually be a fully modular python MIDI parser/interpreter/sequencer
that will be able to input instructions from anywhere,
and output instructions to anywhere.
It will also make working with MIDI info very simple,
allowing your application to easily alter MIDI instructions
as they are being routed.

Keep an eye out!
